# Kitty with multiplicative font scaling

this is more of a personal repo so i can quickly install this patch,
this is a basic patch which makes `decrease_font_size` and `increase_font_size`
multiply/divide the font size by 1.2 instead of simply adding/subtracting 2.
this makes zooming in with these actions feel more like emacs.
the affected functions are legacy so :/

the pkgbuild is a copy of the regular aur pkgbuild

# a better solution has been added to the offical kitty repo so this is unnecessary now
